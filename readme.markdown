# hyperboot-reader

UI for managing hyperboot app versions

Think of hyperboot-reader like an rss reader for web applications.

When you're online, new versions might appear but you (the user) have the final
say over which versions you use.

When you're offline, all of your previously installed versions of apps keep on
working just the same.

Apps might come from http or they might come from nowhere in particular with
content gathered from peer to peer networks like webtorrent and ipfs.
